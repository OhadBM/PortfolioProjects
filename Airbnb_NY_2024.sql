Airbnb Listings Data Analysis â€“ New York City 2024

Project Description  
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings data from New York City for the year 2024 to uncover insights regarding property prices, availability, and host activity. 
The dataset contains more than 37,000 listings with information such as property details, location, price, reviews, and host information.

Using SQL as the primary tool, the data was cleaned, queried, and analyzed to identify trends and anomalies. 
The analysis includes price distributions by room type and neighborhood, identification of the most expensive properties, the most active hosts, and the proportion of listings available year-round.


Summary
* Hotel rooms were the most expensive category, with an average price of $395.
* Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate the market, holding nearly 50% of the total listings.
* Riverdale, SoHo, and Battery Park City ranked among the most expensive neighborhoods.
* Only 9.7% of listings are available all 365 days of the year, showing that most hosts operate seasonally.
* Several "mega-hosts," such as Blueground, manage hundreds of properties, indicating a highly commercialized segment of the market.
